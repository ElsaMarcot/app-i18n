<br/>  
## General Terms of Use  
<br/>  

  
These General Terms of Use (the "T&Cs") are designed to regulate the use by any person (the "User")of the www.inmemori.com web site (the “Site”) published by Rest In Peace (the “Publisher”).

Any access to or use of the Site implies acceptance without reservations of these T&Cs by Users. Users guarantee the Publisher that they have all the rights, authorisations and permissions needed to accept the T&Cs on behalf of them or the company, association or other entity (the “Entity”) in whose name or on whose behalf they access or use the Site.

User’s access or use of the Site implies acceptance without reservations of the T&Cs.

The Publisher shall be entitled to modify these T&Cs at any time. The applicable terms and conditions shall be those that are in force and are accessible on the Site on the date on which the User accesses the Site.

<br/>  
### 1) Presentation of the Site  

The www.inmemori.com Site is intended for people who have just lost a relative, and provides them with a private and personal digital space that can be used:

* to promptly transmit information about the funeral arrangements to all persons concerned,
* to receive the condolences and testimonials of their entourage,
* to organise a collection of donations in their memory.  

How does it work ?

* The administrator (the “Administrator”) accesses inmemori.com and creates a private space, known as a tribute page (the “Tribute Page”), by filling into the administration interface all the necessary information or all information considered to be useful to share: the first name and family name of the deceased, the date on which they passed away, a personalised introductory message, useful information about the funeral (date, time and place of each stage). The Administrator may also organise a collection of funds in memory of the deceased, with the proceeds being earmarked to the family or a charity.
* Once the Tribute Page has been filled in, the Administrator will receive a private sharing link which may then be sent to all the persons concerned via SMS or e-mail.
* Each person who receives the sharing link may view the Tribute Page by clicking on the link. They will then be able to access all the useful information on the funeral arrangements that shall have been entered, and they may also leave a condolence message, share a memory and/or a photograph, and/or take part in the collection.

The Site was designed :

* to enable families to quickly transmit all useful information about funeral arrangements to all the persons concerned;
* to easily enable the relatives of a family to find and access this information, and to make it straight-forward and simple for them to pay tribute to the departed.  

The way in which the Site has been designed, combined with the speed of digital communications, make it a very practical and useful service.

### 2) Creation and activation of a Tribute Page  

Administrators create Tribute Pages by accessing the Site or through an affiliated partner of the Publisher. For the purposes of these T&Cs, any Administrator is deemed to be an User of the Site.

Any Administrator wishing to create a Tribute Page must fill in the form featuring on the home page of the Site. Administrators will then be redirected to the administration interface of the Tribute Page and go through the various stages of creating the Tribute Page.

Once an Administrator has completed a Tribute Page, they will be asked to share it via SMS and/or e-mail.

As soon as the Tribute Page has been created, the Administrator will receive an e-mail containing the link to the administration interface; they may thus administer the Tribute Page that they shall have created (see section 3 of these T&Cs).

As soon as the Tribute Page has been completed, the Administrator will also receive an e-mail containing the sharing link to be transmitted to all the persons potentially concerned by the Tribute Page.

### 3) Functionalities of the Tribute Page 

The Administrator has access to the following functionality via the administration interface accessible from the administration link:

* Retrieve the active sharing link of the Tribute Page in order to transmit it easily to the persons involved;
* View a hit counter showing the number of people who access the Tribute Page;
* View and delete any messages posted on the Tribute Page;
* View the message counter;
* View an outline summary of all the messages, memories and/or photographs uploaded or posted to the Tribute Page;
* Organise a collection;
* Find out how many people have made a donation;
* Retrieve the contact details of people who have left a message, a memory, a photograph and/or made a donation on the Tribute Page;
* Retrieve the list of the donors and the corresponding sums pledged;
* Bring the collection to a close;
* Modify the Tribute Page at any time;
* Add any person as an Administrator of the Tribute Page; each Administrator will then have access to the administration interface and the Administrators functionalities;
* Close the Tribute Page at any time.  

### 4) Access  

Users who receive a sharing link can access the corresponding Tribute Page by simply clicking on the link.  

Users may receive the sharing link to the Tribute Page from an Administrator and/or from another User who received this link beforehand.  

### 5) The Administrator's obligations  

Any violation of these T&Cs by the Administrator may lead to the suspension of his access to the Site and the erasure of the Tribute Page, notwithstanding any compensation that the Publisher may also be entitled to claim.

The Publisher shall therefore be entitled to refuse any activation of a Tribute Page that violates or has violated the provisions of the present T&Cs.

Administrators shall be responsible for all the data that they fill directly into the Site and into a Tribute Page (see section 8 of these T&Cs).

### 6) Contribution  

Users who view a Tribute Page may contribute to it as follows:

* By leaving a message: to do so, Users must input their family name, first name and e-mail address, and type the message that they want to leave on the Tribute Page, enclosing a photograph if they wish.
* By sharing a memory: to do so, Users must input their family name, first name and e-mail address, and record the memory that they wish to leave on the Tribute Page, enclosing a photograph if they wish.
* By sharing a photograph: to do so, Users must input their family name, first name and e-mail address, and upload the photograph that they wish to feature on the Tribute Page.
* By taking part in a collection: to do so, Users must input their family name, first name, e-mail address and nationality, their country of residence, their date of birth and the sum that they wish to pledge.  

Users are hereby informed that the Administrator can (i) retrieve the e-mail addresses of the Users who have left a message, a memory, a photograph and/or who have made a donation on the Tribute Page, (ii) download the content of the messages, memories and photographs input or uploaded by the Users on the Tribute Page, (iii) remove a message, a memory and/or a photograph input or uploaded by the Users, without the Users being notified.

The content of the Site, other than the content and information uploaded or posted by the Users, that is included or accessible on and/or through the Site, such as any text, graphics, logo, name, trademark, designation, tab, functionality, image, sound, data, photograph, and any other hardware or software (the “Publisher Content”) is the exclusive property of the Publisher or of its licensees, and is protected by intellectual property law, being subject to all the applicable laws and regulations in this respect.

Moreover, the Users shall be barred from modifying, improving, printing, translating, decompiling, disassembling or creating one or more derivative work(s) based wholly or partly on the Publisher Content, unless this possibility is expressly granted to them by the Publisher or by the owners of this content under a separate agreement.

### 8) Liability  

#### 8.1) The Publisher's liability  

The Publisher provides to the Users on the Site a certain amount of content and information created and published by other Users or by Administrators. The Users, as authors, shall alone be responsible for the content and information that they publish on the Site. Therefore, the Publisher hereby disclaims liability should the content or information published by Other Users violate any prevailing laws and regulations or cause any harm to a User or to any person.

THE CONTENT AND INFORMATION IS PROVIDED BY THE USERS AND/OR THE ADMINSTRATORS AND DISSEMINATED BY THE PUBLISHER AS IS AND FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THE PUBLISHER DOES NOT IN ANY WAY CERTIFY THE RELIABILITY OF THE INFORMATION DISCLOSED BY THE USERS AND/OR THE ADMINISTRATORS, AND IN PARTICULAR ANY TEXTS, NAMES OR PHOTOGRAPHS THAT THEY UPLOAD TO THE SITE. THE PUBLISHER STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT USERS AND ADMINISTRATORS CHECK THE INFORMATION THAT THEY UPLOAD TO THE SITE WITH PARTICULAR CARE IN LIGHT OF THE HIGHLY EMOTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THIS INFORMATION IS SHARED. THE PUBLISHER HEREBY WARNS THE USERS AND ADMINISTRATORS AGAINST THE CONSEQUENCES OF A FALSE TRIBUTE PAGE, TO WIT AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE DEATH OF A PERSON WHO IS NOT IN FACT DECEASED, FOR WHICH THE PUBLISHER HEREBY DISCLAIMS LIABILITY.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PUBLISHER EXCLUDE ALL CONDITIONS, WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR OTHER TERMS WHICH MAY APPLY TO THE SERVICE OR ANY CONTENT ON IT, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

THE PUBLISHER WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO ANY USER FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE, ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH:

* USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SITE; OR
* USE OF OR RELIANCE ON ANY PRODUCT OR CONTENT DISPLAYED ON THE SITE
THAT IN PARTICULAR, THE PUBLISHER WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR:
* LOSS OF PROFITS, SALES, BUSINESS, OR REVENUE;
* BUSINESS INTERRUPTION;
* LOSS OF DATA OR OTHER PROGRAMS;
* LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS;
* LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, GOODWILL OR REPUTATION; OR
* ANY INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGE.

THE PUBLISHER WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY A VIRUS, DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACK, OR OTHER TECHNOLOGICALLY HARMFUL MATERIAL THAT MAY INFECT COMPUTER EQUIPMENT, COMPUTER PROGRAMS, DATA OR OTHER PROPRIETARY MATERIAL DUE TO THE USE OF THE SITE OR THE DOWNLOADING OF ANY CONTENT ON IT, OR ON ANY WEBSITE LINKED TO IT.

NOTHING IN THESE TERMS EXCLUDES OR LIMITS THE LIABILITY OF THE PUBLISHER FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY ARISING FROM OUR NEGLIGENCE, OR OUR FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY LAW.

Users may report any abuse (such as content that infringes the intellectual property rights of others, content that incites hatred or violence, that is pornographic or contains nudity or gratuitous violence) that they notice on the Site by clicking on the “report abuse” link. They will then be asked to send an electronic message to the address abus@inmemori.com. They may also send an electronic message to this address directly.

#### 8.2) The Users' liability 

By providing content or information on the Site (text, photographs, comments or names), Users must comply with the prevailing statutes and regulations. Users must ensure that the storage and the publication of this content or of this information via the Site does not constitute (i) an infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties, (ii) an affront to personal dignity (e.g. defamation, insults, curses, etc.) or of the right to privacy, (iii) a threat to public order and public morals (such as apologia for crimes against humanity, incitement to racial hatred, child pornography, etc.). By uploading content or information and making it publicly available on and/or through the Site, Users guarantee that they hold all the rights and authorisations required from the rights holders involved and that they have paid for all the rights and payments due under these T&Cs to the appropriate performing rights management companies.

Failing this, the content or the information may be withdrawn from the Site without any prior formality. Moreover, Users may personally face criminal punishments specific to the contentious content (prison sentences and fines), in addition to the prospect of being ordered to pay damages. Given the community nature of the Site, and out of respect for the sensibilities of all, Users are expected to act with a certain sense of respect and ethics when it comes the nature of the content, information and/or comments that they upload, and should refrain in particular from disseminating any content of a violent or pornographic nature.

Users agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Publisher and each of its and their respective directors, officers, managers, employees, shareholders, agents, representatives and licensors, from and against any and all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that arise out of the Users use of the Site, violation of these T&C’s or violation of any rights of another. The Publisher reserves the right to take over the exclusive defense of any claim he is entitled to indemnification under this section. In such event, Users agree to provide the Publisher cooperation as reasonably requested.

#### 8.3) The Site is subject to the constraints linked to the Internet  

The Users declare that they are fully aware of the characteristics and limitations of the Internet network, through which the Publisher provides the Site and the Tribute Page. The Users therefore acknowledge that (i) the transmission of data over the Internet is only relatively reliable in technical terms, given that the data circulates over heterogeneous networks with differing characteristics and technical capacities, that are sometimes saturated at certain times of the day; (ii) data transiting over Internet is not protected against the possibility of misappropriation, and any information that is published may be intercepted, (iii) it is impossible to control the use that third parties may make of data transmitted over the Internet.

Therefore, the Publisher disclaims liability for any of the above mentioned facts or events.

The Publisher also disclaims liability for any force majeure, including a malfunction of the Internet network, of the telephone lines, of a User’s receiving terminal, which prevents or impedes the use of the Site and the administration or viewing of the Tribute Page.

### 11) Third party links

The Site may link to other sites on the "Internet". These sites may contain information or material that some people may find inappropriate or offensive. These other sites are not under the control of the Publisher and the Publisher is not responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, decency, or any other aspect of the content of such sites. The inclusion of such a link does not imply endorsement of any site by the Publisher or any association with its operators.

Any area of the Site that is accessed through any third party proprietary online service is subject to the rules, policies and guidelines of such third party proprietary online service.

### 12) Cookies  

See the cookies policy which forms an integral part of these T&Cs.

The logs kept in the Publisher’s systems in keeping with the highest standards of security shall be considered as evidence of the exchanges of electronic messages, sending of registration forms, and uploading of content. The registration forms shall be archived on a medium that ensures their accurate and lasting storage as required by the prevailing legal provisions. In case of divergence between the Publisher’s logs and any documents kept by the Users in paper or electronic format, the Publisher’s logs shall prevail and shall have evidential value.
