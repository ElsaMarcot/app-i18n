They remind us that sharing our experiences with one another, seeing our loved one through someone else's eyes is life-giving, in a moment of what seems like vast emptiness.\n\nWe have dedicated ourselves to providing a free service that families can use to mourn, to heal, and to celebrate. \n\nJust in the past year, we have supported 100,000 people. With InMemori, we hope to reveal the essentials of life, celebrating the moments that mark us, those that make us human."
