They can remind someone else of certain memories or character traits that would have otherwise been forgotten, bringing a momentary and eternal smile to their lips."

For example, if you pay $250 for the price of a $50 ticket to a charity ball, only $200 is tax-deductible, whether or not you attend the event.\nTo claim a deduction for cash, check, or monetary gifts, you must keep a bank record, payroll deduction record, or written communication from the charity organization that includes the date and amount of the contribution. For contributions totaling $250 or more, you must also include a description of any property contributed, and whether any goods or services were given in exchange for the gift.\nAdditional forms may be required to claim deduction for contributions over a certain amount (for example, Form 8283 for non-cash contributions over $500, and Section B of Form 8283 for contributions valued at over $5000).\n\nSource : <a href='https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/charitable-contributions-how-much-can-you-write-off"
